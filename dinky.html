    <h3>I'm the mayor of these parts.</h3>
    <p>You may have seen me around.</p>
    <p>I've lived in this apartment complex a long time.</p>
    <p>My favorite things to do are:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Lie on top of your car after you get back from a drive.</li>
      <li>Chase the squirrels into your patio.</li>
      <li>Lie in the middle of your path when you are trying to get to work.</li>
    </ol>
