    <h3>I'm the mayor of these parts.</h3>
    <p>You may have seen me around.</p>
    <p>I've lived in this apartment complex a <em>long</em> time.</p>
    <p>My favorite things to do are:</p>
     <ol>
      <li><strong>Lie on top of your car</strong> after you get back from a drive.</li>
      <li><strong>Chase the squirrels</strong> into your patio.</li>
      <li><strong>Lie</strong> in the middle of your path <em>when you are trying to get to work.</em></li>
    </ol>
