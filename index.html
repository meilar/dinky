    <h3>I'm the mayor of these parts.</h3>
    <p>You may have seen me around.</p>
    <p>I've lived in this apartment complex a <em>long</em> time.</p>
    <p>My favorite things to do are:</p>
     <ol>
      <li><strong>Lie on top of your car</strong> after you get back from a drive.</li>
      <li><strong>Chase the squirrels</strong> into your patio.</li>
      <li><strong>Lie</strong> in the middle of your path <em>when you are trying to get to work.</em></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Winter is my slow season. There's not much food on the ground. It gets very cold. During the day I like to sit underneath the dryer vents and take a nap in the hot steam. It makes me smell like clean laundry.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I wonder what this place is going to be like when I'm gone. Visions come to me in dreams: <em>the neighbors across the street are moving out. They needed a little more space. A couple moves in. He's a drain technician and parks his red truck in the carport. She's a nurse. The teachers next door to them move out. Two boys move in. They both work at the auto parts store.</em></p>
    <p>Who will remember me when I am gone?</p>
    <p><strong>Who will remember to fill my bowl?</strong></p>
